## Translate a complex XML File

See xml_translate.py:https://github.com/scott-w-maxwell/automation/blob/main/xml_translate.py

- Ensure to install the correct version of googletrans for this: 4.0.0-rc.1
- It should take care of a decent amount of edge cases, but it's not perfect
- Run the script ```python3 xml_stranlsate``` and you will be prompted to enter the language and xml file path
- The completed file will then output to the same directory
